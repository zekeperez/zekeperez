# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Zekiel Perez. A Full-Time Software Developer, but also a Gamer and Game Developer.

### My Work
My repositories either highlight my achievements or acts as a base guide for future projects I'm working on that I felt like sharing.

### Music
As a clarinetist for 3 years, bagging a Distinction for Singapore Youth Festival, and a certified Grade 6 acoustic guitarist, I bring my musicality to my passion for game development, often composing music for it. See my compositions and arrangements here: https://sites.google.com/view/zp-eportfolio/music
