# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Zekiel Perez. I am a Game Developer using Unity and C#. I graduated with a Diploma in Game Design and Development. I am actively looking out for people to collaborate with to create games, both paid and un-paid, so do not hesitate to contact me if you need a developer or project manager for your team!

### My Work
My repositories either highlight my achievements or act as a base guide for future projects I'm working on that I felt like sharing. 
Do note that I won't be sharing source codes of games I will be publicly releasing.

If you are an employer wishing to see my personal projects that are privated, please contact me first.
